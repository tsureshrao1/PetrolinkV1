              <p> Dear colleagues, partners and stakeholders, Demand for energy is continuously expanding in line with increasing world’s population & the developing economies. 
                Oil and gas sector is expected to maintain its leading position in meeting growing energy needs across the globe. This will lead to significant supply requirements from both the upstream and downstream oil and gas sectors. Basically, our mission is to exploit lucrative opportunities in oil & gas sector and alternative sources of energies. We target to accomplish our mission through multiple channels including acquisitions, taking equity positions, joint ventures, and by participating in green-field projects. Focusing on the said opportunities “PetroLink Holding Company” has been established to explore the growing energy demands and at the same time enhancing the economic development of the countries in which it operates.</p>
              <p>
                Our primary goal is to generate capital gains and achieve superior returns for our investors. We have implemented an aggressive strategy which will make our organization a leading energy investment company with a core focus on the exploration and production in international oil & gas sector.
                We have a vibrant & energetic team to make sure that our vision & mission is achieved through our positive contribution to a sustainable energy future for this region & the world.
                Finally, I would like to thank our Governing Board, employees, partners and all of stakeholders for their dedication and continued support as we look forward to maintain continuous growth and achieve more success in the future.
